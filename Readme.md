# üîê Auth-Core ‚Äî Development Documentation

## Overview

Auth-Core is a reusable authentication library built with Node.js and Express, designed to support multiple authentication strategies such as:

* Email + Password
* Phone Number + OTP
* OAuth logins like Google, Apple, GitHub

It provides token and session handling, but **does not handle database or storage logic directly**. Instead, it allows the host application to inject all storage, lookup, and formatting logic through a flexible configuration interface.

The library is **project-agnostic** and built to be reused without modification across different codebases, regardless of variations in model names (e.g., `User`, `Player`, `AdminAccount`).

---

## Goals

* Provide pluggable authentication for various strategies
* Return JWT tokens and/or set HttpOnly cookies
* Allow custom user models, token payloads, and serialization logic
* Delegate all storage and user-related logic to the consuming project
* Support multiple external login providers with Passport.js
* Offer middleware utilities to attach user data dynamically

---

## Core Features

### Authentication Strategies

* Email and password-based login
* Phone number and OTP-based login
* OAuth login via Google, Apple, GitHub (and extensible to others)
* Optional integration with Passport.js for third-party login providers

### Token & Session Handling

* Generate JWT tokens with fully customizable payloads
* Optional support for HttpOnly cookies for session management
* Token verification via Authorization headers or cookies

### Middleware System

* Middleware to attach authenticated user to request
* Extendable middleware to attach additional information like role, permissions, organization, etc.
* Middleware layers are composable and include only what is needed by the host application

### Configuration-Driven Architecture

* All project-specific logic is injected via config:

  * User lookup
  * OTP handling
  * Token structure
  * OAuth post-login handling
* No assumptions are made about user object structure or database implementation

---

## Customization Hooks

The following hooks must be implemented by the host application and passed to the library during initialization:

* `findUserByEmail`: Retrieve user by email
* `onOtpRequest`: Logic to send/store OTP
* `verifyOtp`: Logic to validate the OTP
* `serializeUser`: Define the user object structure returned from the auth library
* `generateTokenPayload`: Define the structure of the JWT payload
* `oauthCallbackHandler`: Handle user creation or lookup after OAuth login

These hooks give full control to the host project and allow complete decoupling of database logic from the library.

---

## Middleware Capabilities

The middleware system is designed to be dynamic and composable. The host project can specify what data should be included on the request object for each route:

* Attach authenticated user (`req.user`)
* Attach user role (`req.role`)
* Attach organization or tenant info (`req.org`)
* Additional fields can be added as needed in future

Only the required fields will be computed and attached, keeping performance optimal and implementation minimal per route.

---

## Token Payload Flexibility

The JWT token generated by the library will use a payload defined completely by the host project. There are no required or reserved fields like `uid`, `role`, etc. The host project can include any fields using any naming convention.

---

## OAuth Strategy Support

Auth-Core integrates with Passport.js to support multiple third-party login strategies such as Google, Apple, and GitHub. The host project is responsible for handling what happens after a successful login ‚Äî such as creating or updating a user ‚Äî through the `oauthCallbackHandler`.

---

## Design Principles

* The package **must not be modified per project**.
* The same package should work across projects with different user model structures.
* All logic differences are handled through injected configuration and callbacks.
* The core package contains only authentication and token/session logic.
* Data fetching, updating, storage, and interpretation are the responsibility of the host project.

---

## Benefits

* Fully decoupled and reusable across multiple codebases
* Minimal and efficient ‚Äî no DB code inside the package
* Strong separation of concerns
* Easily extensible for new authentication methods or providers
* Zero hardcoded assumptions about user data or project structure

---

## Usage Summary

* Auth-Core is initialized once with a full configuration object.
* The host application defines all custom logic through injectable hooks.
* Routes use composable middlewares and authentication handlers.
* Token and cookie behavior are controlled entirely by configuration.
* OAuth strategies are plugged in without needing code changes in the core library.
